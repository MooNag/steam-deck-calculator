# AS OF 2022-7-29 The calculator is now archived/unsupported; due to a production update from Valve. All new orders are in Q4, if that queue fills up orders will go into the next quarter.

Accuracy has been within +-2 weeks for most users, and estimates still may be useful for Q3.

Site to estimate order availability for the steam deck.

Deployed at https://steam-deck-calculator.web.app/

It is designed to be extensible and if you are a developer, easy to add your own calculator to (submit PRs).

It is using pure JS, CSS, and HTML for simplicity. Typing would be nice, but not everyone has a typescript environment.

TODO
 - add docs for csv data format.
 - update site to have css
 - add cool stats like distributions and charts
